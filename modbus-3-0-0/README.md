# 1. Overview

The SE Modbus Tag node is an evolution of the SE Modbus Basic node. SE Modbus node V3.0.0 is a package of three nodes namely SE Modbus Read, SE Modbus Write and SE Modbus Tag node.

  1. SE Modbus Read node: This node is used to read the data from modbus devices using modbus
  TCP or modbus Serial communication protocol.
  2. SE Modbus Write node: This node is used to write the data to modbus devices using the
  modbus TCP or modbus serial communication protocol.
  3. SE Modbus Tag node: This node can import tags that are exported from EcoStruxure Control
  Expert or any other PLC configuration software to perform a read/write operation


The output of SE Modbus nodes is in Common Message Structure format.

Henceforth, we will refer this package as SE Modbus nodes in the document.

# 8. Help Manual

* SE Modbus node user manual can be downloaded using the Help Icon in the top right menu.

# 9. License

* SE Modbus node is available under Schneider Electric license.
* The license file can be downloaded using the License Icon in the top right menu

# 10. Information

* Supported Language is English only.
* Node-RED Editor Debug window shows maximum 1000 register values only.
* When user wants to write Boolean data from inject node and provides value array other than 0 and 1 if the PLC is accepting the values other than 0 and 1 as a Boolean type then modbus write will be successful
* When you launch a Node-RED server, it takes time to get started, in order to avoid this refer to Commissioning of Node-RED procedure (TechPub Document page 51- steps 11 to 14).

# 11. Limitations

SE Modbus nodes have the following limitations:
1. Node-RED application is supported in any browser with V8 engine or similar (for example: Google chrome V73.0, Firefox V66.0)
2. Node-RED web page is only available in English, irrespective of the system language.
3. Modbus protocol limitations to read data from a modbus device are as follows:
    *  Read Coil Status: 2000
    *  Read Input Status: 2000
    *  Read Holding Registers: 125
    *  Read Input Registers: 125
4. Modbus protocol limitations to write data from a modbus device are as follows:
    *  Force Single Coil: 1
    *  Preset Single Register: 1
    *  Force Multiple Coils: 1968
    *  Preset Multiple Registers: 123
5. When the user wants to do the offline installation, the internet should be disabled. It takes longer to install if the internet is enabled.
6. For optimum performance, in one Edge Box, consider deploying 4 SE Modbus Read nodes (with maximum 125 holding registers) along with publishing nodes. In this scenario, 4 SE Modbus Read nodes will enable overall 500 tags to be read.
7. SE Modbus Tag node can import maximum of 500 tags to be read. For optimum performance, in one Edge Box, consider deploying 4 SE Modbus Tag nodes with maximum 500 tags configured per node.
8. SE Modbus node supports 8 data types which are INT, UINT, WORD, REAL, DINT, UDINT, DWORD and BOOLEAN. Other data types are not supported.
9. Modbus Serial communication with BSC Box could not be established using USB to serial converter cable (TCSMCNAM3M002P) due to unavailability of driver for Linux platform.


# 12. Known Issues

* Modbus TCP communication with M340 PLC device has connection issue with BSC Box (Linux kernel Environment) in the following cases
    1. Two different Node-RED Servers(running in two boxes) try to access the same M340
    2. One Node-RED Server(running in one box) tries to access any other TCP device along with one M340
* Performance degradation may occur when  node usage is not per the performance  model mentioned in the Section 11(Limitation 6 and 7).  This may  be improved  once  the mitigation is put in place with upgraded version of node modbus-serial v8.0.0. Next release version of the node will include a patch fix to upgrade certain libraries.
